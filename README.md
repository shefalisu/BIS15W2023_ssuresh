## Shefali's BIS 15 Winter 2023
Welcome! This quarter I have furthered my interest in the field of bioinformatics by taking an **Introduction to Data Science for Biologists** course at UC Davis. I have no experience with coding in the R language but I hope to improve my skills by the end of the quarter. This repository includes the homework, notes, and labs that I will do during this course.
