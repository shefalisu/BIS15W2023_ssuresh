## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Plant height
```{r}
plant_1 <- c(30.7)
plant_2 <- c(37.6)
plant_3 <- c(28.4)
plant_4 <- c(NA)
plant_5 <- c(33.2)
```

```{r}
plant_height <- c(30.7, 37.6, 28.4, NA, 33.2)
```

#Titles for variables 
```{r}
sample <- c("plant1", "plant2", "plant3", "plant4", "plant5")
values <- c("height", "mass")
```

#Plant Mass
```{r}
mass_1 <-c(4)
mass_2 <-c(5.2)
mass_3 <-c(3.7)
mass_4 <- c(NA)
mass_5 <- c(4.6)
```

```{r}
plant_mass <- c(4, 5.2, 3.7, NA, 4.6)
```

#Combine mass and height data 
```{r}
plant_experiment <- c(plant_height, plant_mass)
plant_experiment
```

##Build Matrix
```{r}
plant_matrix <- matrix(plant_experiment, nrow = 5, byrow = F)
plant_matrix
```


##Name Columns and Rows 

```{r}
colnames(plant_matrix) <- values
rownames(plant_matrix) <- sample
```


##Print Matrix 
```{r}
plant_matrix
```


##Calculate Column Means

```{r}
plant_means <- colMeans(plant_matrix, na.rm = T)
plant_means
```
