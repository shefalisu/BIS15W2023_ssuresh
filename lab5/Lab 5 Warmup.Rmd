## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Load tidyverse

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```


#Load Bison Data 
```{r}
bison <- readr::read_csv("data/bison.csv")
```

#Dimensions and Structure 

```{r}
dim(bison)
```

```{r}
glimpse(bison)
```

#New Data Frame: (code, sex, weight, year of birth)

```{r}
bison_new <- select(bison, "animal_code", "animal_sex", "animal_weight", "animal_yob")
bison_new
```
#animals born between 1980-1990.
```{r}
bison_range <- filter(bison_new, between(animal_yob, 1980, 1990))
```

# How many male and female bison are represented between 1980-1990?

```{r}
table(bison_range$animal_sex)
```

#Between 1980-1990, were males or females larger on average?

```{r}
female_bison <- filter(bison_range, animal_sex == "F")
female_bison
```

```{r}
mean(female_bison$animal_weight)
```


```{r}
male_bison <- filter(bison_range, animal_sex == "M")
male_bison
```

```{r}
mean(male_bison$animal_weight)
```
