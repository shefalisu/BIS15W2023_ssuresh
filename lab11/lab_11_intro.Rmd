## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
For this warm-up, please use the `heartrate` data. Be sure to label your plots!


```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
```


```{r}
heartrate <- readr::read_csv("data/heartrate.csv")
```


1. Make a plot that compares the heartrate of patients for drug a.

```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  group_by(patient) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=patient, y= a, fill = patient))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Comparison of Drug A", y = "Heartrate", x = "Patient")
```


2. Make a plot that compares heartrate (as a range) for each drug.

```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  pivot_longer(-patient, 
               names_to = "drug",
               values_to = "heartrate") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=drug, y=heartrate, fill = drug))+
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6)+
  labs(title = "Comparison of Heartrate Drugs", x= "Drug")
```
