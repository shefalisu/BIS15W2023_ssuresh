## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
1. Please load the homerange data `Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv`
2. Show the min, mean, and max log10.mass by taxonomic class in the dataset.
3. Make a plot that best summarizes this output.


```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
```


```{r}
homerange <- readr::read_csv("data/Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv")
```


```{r}
homerange %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(min_log10.mass = min(log10.mass),
            max_log10.mass = max(log10.mass),
            mean_log10.mass = mean(log10.mass),
            median_log10.mass = median(log10.mass))
```


```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_boxplot()
```
