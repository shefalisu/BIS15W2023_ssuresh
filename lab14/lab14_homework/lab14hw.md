## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

To become a data scientist, you need at least a bachelor's degree but a master's or doctoral degree might be required. Yes, it is a growing occupation with a projected growth rate of 36% from 2011-2031. 


2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

In this course I became proficient in the R programming language by learning how to clean and organize data sets, make graphs that best reflect data sets, make apps, and make data matrices and data frames.  


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

My current career interests is in the field of genetics, specifically, bioinformatics.The R programming language is used commonly in bioinformatics because it can be used to analyze and organize sets such as DNA and RNA sequences. 


4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

Some parts that were difficult was troubleshooting code that didn't run. This could be especially frustrating if there were small errors. I also had some trouble understanding faceting as it took me some time to understand what values go where and how it effects the plots. The most rewarding part is being able to overcome a problem that you were stuck on. The feeling of relief and accomplishment sometimes makes the struggle worth it.  


5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I wish I had a little bit of background in R programming before I took this class. This course did an amazing job going over the basics but I feel like I would have understood the material a little better if I had some prior background. This is because it takes me a while to understand what the code does and how to manipulate it so sometimes I felt a little behind when I didn't fully understand the content we learned in class. 

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

If we had 1 more lab, I would have liked to learn about how R is used to analyze genetic information. 


7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

Yes, I plan on getting a minor in bioinformatics so I will be taking more data and computer science classes. 


8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I think working with a partner(s) was extremely helpful in this class because we were able to help each other out and troubleshoot our code. It also made you feel less alone if you didn't understand something right away. If the class transitioned online, I think it would have been a lot harder to learn because you wouldn't get the same hands on learning and help. 


9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.
